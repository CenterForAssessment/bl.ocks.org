# literasee.io Browser Extensions

<http://literasee.io> is a simple Gist viewer for Markdown and HTML/JavaScript examples.

To install the **Chrome** extension, visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/literaseeio/phjkbonaifennbfpmieeipknnkhaoiaf) and click *Add to Chrome*.

To install the **Firefox** extension, visit the [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/literaseeio/). Then click *Add to Firefox*.

A **Safari** extension is no longer supported because Apple requires a $99 per year fee to obtain a developer certificate. Please donâ€™t use Safari.

**Note:** All credit for this extension goes to Mike Bostock as it is a direct
fork of https://github.com/mbostock/bl.ocks.org with some simple find and replace.
